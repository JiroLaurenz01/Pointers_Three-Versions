# Pointers_Three-Versions

This repository contains three versions of a C program that demonstrates the usage of pointers.

## pVersion.c

`pVersion.c` is the initial version of the program that introduces the concept of pointers and demonstrates basic pointer operations.

### How to Compile and Run

To compile and run `pVersion.c`:

```sh
gcc pVersion.c -o pVersion
./pVersion
```

## versionOne.c

`versionOne.c` is an improved version of the program that includes additional features and more advanced pointer manipulation.

### How to Compile and Run

To compile and run `versionOne.c`:

```sh
gcc versionOne.c -o versionOne
./versionOne
```

## versionTwo.c

`versionTwo.c` is the most advanced version of the program, building upon the previous versions and incorporating even more complex pointer concepts.

### How to Compile and Run

To compile and run `versionTwo.c`:

```sh
gcc versionTwo.c -o versionTwo
./versionTwo
```
